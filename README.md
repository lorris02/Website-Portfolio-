## About This Portfolio

This website is my personal portfolio, created to showcase my projects, technical skills, and learning journey in software development. It highlights hands-on work in web development and programming, with a focus on clean code, functionality, and continuous improvement.

This portfolio is continuously updated as I build new projects and expand my technical skill set.
